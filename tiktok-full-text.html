        <h2>TikTok and its Detrimental Effects</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-text">
          <p>
        TikTok, the fasting spreading, most glorified, and addictive substance in today’s world; the application which will destroy the very lives of those in this generation. To many, TikTok and other short form social media apps have become their favorite pastime. A part of TikTok that makes it so appealing to such a large audience is its simplicity: the user watches a 15 second to 1 minute video, decides whether or not they want to like, comment, or follow, and then move on to the next video. This fact, compiled with the advanced AI algorithms TikTok uses to pump out personalized, engaging content to their viewers is a perfect storm to captivate the hearts of those in a society where the latest trends and rapid change dominates, while slowing down and taking time to ‘chill out’ is held with greater scorn day by day. When thinking about an application or object, it is hard for people to discern the true underlying effects that it may bring, TikTok being no exception. Many have the mindset of ‘how can TikTok do anything harmful to me, it's just a silly little app that I use every now and then?’ However, what the world does not recognize is the detrimental effect this social media app can have as seen by the insecurities and mental health issues TikTok catalyzes in users,  the brain alteration constant short form social media causes,  and societies’ glorification of the application.
    </p>
          <p>	TikTok poses great harm to mental health and amplifies the insecurities of its users.  In the advisory of Dr.Vivek Murthy, a U.S Surgeon General, it showed that “close to half of adolescents say that social media makes them feel bad about their body image” (Siegel). This statistic may seem absurd, but it makes complete sense . The videos on TikTok, especially the dancing ones (which happen to some of the most popular), showcase those who made the video in a very deceiving light. By all appearances, those making the video look very joyful, happy, skilled, and attractive. Even though these traits that characterize those in the  video are artificial to say the least  (those who create TikToks are doing so with the intention to post for everyone to see, meaning that they want to appear a certain way in which they seem all put together, even if this means taking dozens upon dozens of takes), the viewer cannot comprehend this. So, when watching, the viewer is going to look back at themselves and inevitably compare themselves to the ‘perfect’ version of those they see on TikTok. This comparison is going to destroy the self-esteem of the majority of users on TikTok as there are without a doubt people who are going to look better or can do something better in their ‘perfect’ form compared to the natural, ‘organic’ state of the common person without any of the filters or retakes. The common viewer will always fall short of the unachievable standard TikTok engraves into their mind. While being interviewed, Dr. Cam (a practicing psychologist who received her pHd from George Mason in adolescent psychology ) notes her concerns with TikTok and what it can do to the mental health of users when they see countless  ‘perfect’ people on their feeds. She talks about the events of COVID-19 where  “everytime we heard the news about the pandemic, it was like our brain would go into like ‘Oh my, it's a pandemic!’ It felt like it was recurring over and over again”. Even though there is no new information and nothing has really changed; the brain reacts in the same distraught manner as when it initially heard the news. Similarly, whenever users look at TikTok videos, the wound of comparison and the feeling of ‘not being good enough’ is never lightened. Dr. Cam points out the severity of this saying that the users of TikTok are not just viewing one or two videos that will merit such a lowering of self-esteem as discussed, but  “are going to find hundreds of thousands of people that are better at something”, meaning a perpetual demeaning of confidence when using the application.

          <p>The threat of TikTok is clear in regards to the mental health implication it may have, yet the larger problem with the app may have to deal with the alteration this app causes to the functionality of the human mind. When someone is watching TikTok and is actively engaged in the video, several “dopamine receptors…are activated and action potentials are subsequently propagated through neural networks” (Fernandez). Then, when a user goes to scroll to the next video, there is this uncertainty whether or not the video will be good or bad, stimulating even more dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain: “the variable pattern of reward in the form of entertaining videos on TikTok simulates the intermittent reward pattern of winning or losing” (Petrillo).  The brain craves for dopamine as it is directly related to pleasure and happiness in the mind; because TikTok can easily satiate the dopamine drive of the human, people will constantly look back to the source to meet their dopamine needs. However, the yearning for substance (in this case dopamine) will only increase as time goes on as it does for any other addictive such as alcohol, nicotine, or weed. This results in TikTok users not being able to feel as much pleasure and happiness in other interactions as they are used to because the dopamine bar for pleasure has been raised so high due to TikTok usage. So, in order to get their fill of dopamine, users of TikTok must resort  to using the app more and more , “feeding into a social media addiction” (Fernandez). It is very important to note that dopamine neurotransmitters are not only responsible for the pleasure of the human mind, but for many other bodily functions such as “memory motivation” (Fernandez). This is significant as when the user takes in so much dopamine from sources such as TikTok with its micro videos, the attention spans and  memory capabilities of users will greatly falter as the mind  is solely being trained to react and recall  this short form content. To make things even worse, the brain cannot even fully digest the former video as it is met instantly with the next giving the brain zero time to convert the event into memory. From this, it is clear this app is designed to destroy the very cognitive abilities of its users. 
    </p>
          <p>With all of this being considered, it is truly frightening to think about the coming state of the world as TikTok (or applications identical in function such as ‘Instagram Reels’ and ‘Youtube Shorts’) is not going anywhere. The latest surveys show that the percentage of American adults who are using at least one social media “has skyrocketed to 72%” (Fernandez). TikTok and Instagram Reels have  “more than 2 billion monthly active users combined” (Shore). With the Earth being so intertwined in the use of this app, the urge to delete the app is met with such great resistance (from societal pressures of staying on because everyone else is on, to the addiction the user will certainly develop when using the app) as to which no change will be made;  society will be caught in the inescapable snare of TikTok. As a result, the harm TikTok imposes will afflict millions, if not billions of people in due time and society as a whole will suffer immensely.
